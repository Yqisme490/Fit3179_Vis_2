            <p>Harvard Business Review calls the role of a data scientist as "the sexiest job of the 21st century".  
                In 2022, data science ranked in the top five most in-demand and highest paying jobs in Australia. Its annual average 
                growth rate is predicted to be 2.4 per cent, according to Deloitte, a whole percentage point higher than the average 
                job rate growth.</p>

                            <b>Work Life Balance</b> and <b>Culture and Values</b>. We can see that private companies have relatively higher average values than 
                            public companies in each of these five criteria. Therefore, we can conclude that <b>private companies</b> are more desirable for data scientists 
                            in Australia.
